Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals time.acceleration-XYZ and 
time.orientation-XYZ. 
These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using 
a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the 
acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBody.acceleration-XYZ and timeGravity.acceleration-XYZ) using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBody.acceleration.jerksignal-XYZ 
and timeBody.orientation.jerksignal-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(timeBody.accelleration.magnitude, timeGravity.accelleration.magnitude, timeBody.accelleration.jerksignal.magnitude, timeBody.orientation.magnitude, 
timeBody.orientation.jerksignal.magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freqBody.acceleration-XYZ, freqBody.accelleration.jerksignal-XYZ, 
freqBody.orientation-XYZ, freqBody.accelleration.jerksignal.magnitude, freqBody.orientation.magnitude, freqBody.orientation.jerksignal.magnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


These are the variables in the dataset. All 'time' variables indicate time in seconds. All 'freq' variables indicate the 
frequency in times/second.
